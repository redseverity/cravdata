**cravtool**  — dynamic URL & file brute‑forcing toolkit

cravtool is a Go tool for directory enumeration on URLs and offline analysis of files/hashes. Instead of relying solely on large static wordlists, cravtool dynamically generates candidates for path discovery and includes modules for processing and analyzing hashes/files. Built for authorized pentests, CTFs, and security labs — efficient, modular, and designed for responsible use.
